## Overview

The **Golf Game** is an interactive two-player golf simulation game. It allows users to compete either against another player or a computer (in auto mode). Players aim to complete each hole in as few swings as possible. Swings are judged based on chance and dictated by the roll of the dice. The game tracks scores across multiple holes, calculating performance based on par values for each hole. It can be stopped at any time, and scores are evaluated, so users do not need the time for a full 9 holes. This game might be used as an easy and quick way to pass free time with a friend or by yourself. It is targeted at people of all ages and just for passing fun. We do not yet store data for leaderboards or ongoing competitions.

## Game Rules

- The game consists of multiple holes, each with its own par score, which represents the expected number of swings to complete the hole.
- Players take turns hitting the golf ball toward the hole.
- Players can choose to manually swing or enable an "Auto" mode for the second player, simulating play against a computer.
- The player with the fewest swings wins each hole.
- After both players finish a hole, the par score of that hole is added to their overall score.
- The game ends after completing all the holes, and the player with the lowest overall score wins.
